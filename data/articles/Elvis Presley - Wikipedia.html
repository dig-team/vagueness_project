<p><b>Elvis Aaron Presley</b><sup id="cite_ref-name_5-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-name-5">[a]</a></sup> (January 8, 1935&nbsp;‚Äì August 16, 1977), also known simply as <b>Elvis</b>, was an American singer, musician and actor. He is regarded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Elvis_Presley" title="Cultural impact of Elvis Presley">one of the most significant cultural icons</a> of the 20th century and is often referred to as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music" title="Honorific nicknames in popular music">King of Rock and Roll</a>" or simply "the King". His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement" title="Civil rights movement">transformative era in race relations</a>, led him to great success‚Äîand initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Elvis_Presley#Danger_to_American_culture" title="Cultural impact of Elvis Presley">controversy</a>.
</p><p>Presley was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupelo,_Mississippi" title="Tupelo, Mississippi">Tupelo, Mississippi</a>, and relocated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records" title="Sun Records">Sun Records</a> with producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Phillips" title="Sam Phillips">Sam Phillips</a>, who wanted to bring the sound of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_music" title="African-American music">African-American music</a> to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Moore" title="Scotty Moore">Scotty Moore</a> and bassist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Black" title="Bill Black">Bill Black</a>, was a pioneer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockabilly" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a>, an uptempo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbeat_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Backbeat (music)">backbeat</a>-driven fusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music" title="Country music">country music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" title="Rhythm and blues">rhythm and blues</a>. In 1955, drummer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Fontana" title="D. J. Fontana">D. J. Fontana</a> joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Victor" class="mw-redirect" title="RCA Victor">RCA Victor</a> acquired his contract in a deal arranged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Tom_Parker" title="Colonel Tom Parker">Colonel Tom Parker</a>, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreak_Hotel" title="Heartbreak Hotel">Heartbreak Hotel</a>", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a>.
</p><p>In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Me_Tender_(film)" title="Love Me Tender (film)">Love Me Tender</a></i>. Drafted into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_career_of_Elvis_Presley" title="Military career of Elvis Presley">military service in 1958</a>, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(1968_TV_program)" title="Elvis (1968 TV program)">Elvis</a></i>, which led to an extended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_from_Hawaii_Via_Satellite" title="Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite">Aloha from Hawaii</a></i>. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland" title="Graceland">Graceland</a> estate at the age of 42.
</p><p>With his rise from poverty to significant fame, Presley's success seemed to epitomize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</a>. He is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists" title="List of best-selling music artists">best-selling solo music artist of all time</a>, and was commercially successful in many genres, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_pop" title="Traditional pop">pop</a>, country, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%26B" class="mw-redirect" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_contemporary" class="mw-redirect" title="Adult contemporary">adult contemporary</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music" title="Gospel music">gospel</a>. He won three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a>, received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award" title="Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award">Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at age 36, and has been inducted into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_halls_of_fame_inducting_Elvis_Presley" title="List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley">multiple music halls of fame</a>. Presley holds several records; the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</a> certified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_certification" title="RIAA certification">gold</a> and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200" title="Billboard 200"><i>Billboard</i> 200</a>, and the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart" title="UK Albums Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and the most number-one singles by any act on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart" title="UK Singles Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>.

A classmate later recalled that the teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199436_32-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199436-32">[30]</a></sup> He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullied</a> by classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199435‚Äì38_33-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199435%E2%80%9338-33">[31]</a></sup> In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Denson" title="Lee Denson">Lee Denson</a>, a neighbor two and a half years his senior.

<p>In August 1953, Presley checked into the offices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records" title="Sun Records">Sun Records</a>. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate_disc" title="Acetate disc">acetate disc</a>: "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Happiness_(popular_song)" class="mw-redirect" title="My Happiness (popular song)">My Happiness</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_When_Your_Heartaches_Begin" title="That&#39;s When Your Heartaches Begin">That's When Your Heartaches Begin</a>". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guralnick" title="Peter Guralnick">Peter Guralnick</a> argued that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Keisker" title="Marion Keisker">Marion Keisker</a> what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds." When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, "I don't sound like nobody." After he recorded, Sun boss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Phillips" title="Sam Phillips">Sam Phillips</a> asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer.

</p><p>Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'"<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMiller200072_57-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller200072-57">[55]</a></sup> In June, he acquired a demo recording by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Sweeney" title="Jimmy Sweeney">Jimmy Sweeney</a> of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer.

<p>The session held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_All_Right" title="That&#39;s All Right">That's All Right</a>". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open&nbsp;... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'"

Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and DJ/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager.

</p><p>Elvis made his first television appearance on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSLA-TV" class="mw-redirect" title="KSLA-TV">KSLA-TV</a> television broadcast of <i>Louisiana Hayride</i>.

By early 1955, Presley's regular <i>Hayride</i> appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Tom_Parker" title="Colonel Tom Parker">Colonel Tom Parker</a>, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.

Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&amp;B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuralnick1994163_79-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuralnick1994163-79">[77]</a></sup> This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay.

<p>While an autopsy, undertaken the same day Presley died, was still in progress, Memphis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner" title="Coroner">medical examiner</a> Dr. Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest.

<p>After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA publicity materials referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998123_371-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998123-371">[367]</a></sup> The number five "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_Not_You" title="She&#39;s Not You">She's Not You</a>" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMarsh1982145_372-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarsh1982145-372">[368]</a></sup> The modern blues/R&amp;B sound captured with success on <i>Elvis Is Back!</i> was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966‚Äì67 recordings as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_in_the_Alley_(The_Clovers_song)" class="mw-redirect" title="Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)">Down in the Alley</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Heel_Sneakers" title="Hi-Heel Sneakers">Hi-Heel Sneakers</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998213,_237_373-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998213,_237-373">[369]</a></sup> Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27O_sole_mio" title="&#39;O sole mio">'O sole mio</a>" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199965_374-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuralnick199965-374">[370]</a></sup> These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998142‚Äì43_375-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998142%E2%80%9343-375">[371]</a></sup>
</p><p>While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they were "hard to find".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998343_376-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJorgensen1998343-376">[372]</a></sup> A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk" title="Funk">funk</a>. Much of <i>Elvis in Memphis</i>, as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPonce_de_Leon2007199_377-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPonce_de_Leon2007199-377">[373]</a></sup>

In the case of his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred. For most of the 1960s, his recording career focused on soundtrack albums. In the 1970s, his most heavily promoted and best-selling LP releases tended to be concert albums.
